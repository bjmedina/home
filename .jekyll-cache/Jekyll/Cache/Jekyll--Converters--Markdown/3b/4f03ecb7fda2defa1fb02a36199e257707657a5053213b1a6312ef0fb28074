<p>My name is Bryan Medina, an undergrad in Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Central Florida working with Josh McDermott in the <a href="http://mcdermottlab.mit.edu/">Lab for Computational Audition</a> at MIT.

<p>As far as my research interests go, I am very interested in understanding the neural mechanisms that underlie human perception, especially of sound. Currently, I am studying the viability of deep neural networks as a normative model for pitch perception.</p>

<p>Aside from my research seeking out the brain processes necessary for the human experience, I enjoy biking, cooking new recipes, and playing a number of instruments (typically alto sax or electric guitar). I also find pleasure spending tons of money on my <a href="https://www.discogs.com/user/bj_medina/collection">record collection</a>.</p>

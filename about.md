My name is Bryan Medina, an undergrad in Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Central Florida working with Josh McDermott in the [Lab for Computational Audition](http://mcdermottlab.mit.edu/) at MIT.
If you want to learn more about me, check out my [CV](http://bjmedina.github.io/images/pdf/bjm_cv.pdf).


As far as my research interests go, I am very interested in understanding the neural mechanisms that underlie human perception, especially of sound. Currently, I am studying the viability of deep neural networks as a normative model for pitch perception.

Aside from my research seeking out the brain processes necessary for the human experience, I enjoy biking, cooking new recipes, and playing a number of instruments (typically alto sax or electric guitar). I also find pleasure spending tons of money on my [record collection](https://www.discogs.com/user/bj_medina/collection).

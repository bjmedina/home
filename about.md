My name is Titipat Achakulvisut, a PhD student in the Department of Biomedical
Engineering at Northwestern University working at [Konrad Kording's lab](http://kordinglab.com/)
at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago. You can find out more info about me in my
[CV](http://titipata.github.io/images/pdf/Titipat_CV.pdf)


I collaborate with [Daniel Acuna](http://www.scienceofscience.org/) in a relatively new field known as Science of Science.
You can also find out about other projects on my Github [@titipata](https://github.com/titipata).


Here are some of my projects with [@daniel-acuna](https://github.com/daniel-acuna) and [@evadyer](https://github.com/evadyer)

> **Visualization of all universities in the world, their topics, and expertise** [map.scienceofscience.org](http://map.scienceofscience.org/) <br>
> **Computational Neuroscience** [NERDS](https://github.com/KordingLab/nerds)


Here is a list of softwares that I generally use

> **Programming** Python (`numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `Django`), PySpark, Matlab, R, Mathematica, etc. <br>

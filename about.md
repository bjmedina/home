My name is Titipat Achakulvisut, a PhD student in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Northwestern University.
I am currently working in the [Bayesian Behavior lab](http://klab.smpp.northwestern.edu/wiki/index.php5/Main_Page)
with Prof. Konrad Kording at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago. See more info about me in my
[cv](http://titipata.github.io/images/pdf/Titipat_CV.pdf)


I collaborate with [Daniel Acuna](http://www.scienceofscience.org/) in a relatively new field known as Science of Science.
You can also find out about other projects on my Github [@titipata](https://github.com/titipata).


Here are some of my projects with [@daniel-acuna](https://github.com/daniel-acuna) and [@evadyer](https://github.com/evadyer)
> **Recommendation of posters and PubMed articles based on preferences** [scholarfy.net](http://www.scholarfy.net/), [pubmed.scholarfy.net](http://pubmed.scholarfy.net/) <br>
> **Visualization of all universities in the world, their topics, and expertise** [map.scienceofscience.org](http://map.scienceofscience.org/) <br>
> **Computational Neuroscience** [NERDS](https://github.com/KordingLab/nerds)


I also run a blog, written in Thai, with [@bluenex](https://github.com/bluenex) named [tupleblog](http://tupleblog.github.io/)
where we post geeky, programming stuff (and whatever we like).


Here is a list of software that I generally use
> **Programming** Python (`numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `Django`), PySpark, Matlab, R, Mathematica, etc. <br>
> **Editor** Atom, Emacs <br>
> **Others** LaTeX <br>
> **Cloud Computing** Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Computing

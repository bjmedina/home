My name is Bryan Medina, an incoming Ph.D. student in Brain and Cognitive Sciences at [MIT](http://web.mit.edu/) and a NSF Graduate Research Fellow, where I currently work in the [Lab for Computational Audition](http://mcdermottlab.mit.edu/). Before that, I was an undergrad studying Computer Science, Cognitive Sciences, and Mathematics at the [University of Central Florida](https://www.ucf.edu/). I've also worked with [Dr. Rob Kass](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~kass/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). Feel free to check out my [CV](/cv).

As far as my research interests go, I am very interested in understanding the neural mechanisms that underlie human perception, especially of sound. Currently, I am studying the viability of deep neural networks as a normative model for pitch perception.

Aside from my research, I also find much joy in giving back to my community. As someone who is a Latino first generation student, I believe that it is important that I share my successes with those who look and talk like I do. I've volunteered my time teaching and talking to students not only on campus, but in the community, on how to succeed as a underrepresented minority in STEM. At UCFthe moment, I am the Vice President of the Cognitive Sciences Club @ UCF, a club I co-founded, and Vice President of the UCF SACNAS chapter, organizations that strive to make opportunities available to all.

On my off-time I enjoy biking, baking, playing a number of instruments (typically alto saxophone or electric guitar) and making photographs. I also find pleasure spending tons of money on my [record collection](https://www.discogs.com/user/bj_medina/collection?page=1&limit=100&header=1&layout=big).

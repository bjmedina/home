title: make your personal page using github
---

I created my personal website on Github. Yeah, I mean this one right here.
It's really easy to do. You just create a repository named `username.github.io` and
put your `index.html` file in the repo. Now, you will have
a free sub-domain name in Github at `http://username.github.io`.

Github can host either plain html or Jekyll. Jekyll is really good for
creating a blog since it can render markdown files into a blog.

If you consider hosting a blog or personal website, Github is not a bad choice at all!
I really recommend it for students who want to have their own website. And don't forget to
request [Github education](https://education.github.com/) if you are students.

You can see more information how to create your page at [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

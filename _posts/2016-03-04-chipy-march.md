title: I'm presenting with Daniel at Chicago Python meeting - Chipy
---


I did present my work with Daniel Acuna at [ChiPy](http://www.chipy.org/)
past March 10, 2016. It went great! I'm really glad that my first big talk went well.
You can see more details about the talk and the slide at this [blog post](http://kordinglab.com/2016/03/11/chipy_presentation.html).

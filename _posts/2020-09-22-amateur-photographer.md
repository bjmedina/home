recently ive been obsessed with street photography. there is something about capturing every day life, capturing man-made structures, capturing people doing the routine, that i find beautiful. put simply, i am obsessed with what humans do.

although there aren't many people outside these days, i still try to find some time to shoot.

as a kid, i used to take shots with my nikon coolpix l120 -- but that was pretty limited. as a teenager i used to take shots on my fujifilm instax 9.


i am still learning but here are some shots on my fujifilm x100t.

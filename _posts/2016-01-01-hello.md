title: hello world
---

hello world to my new personal page. I have an actual blog post in Thai
named [tupleblog](http://tupleblog.github.io/) that you can check it out.

And I have to mentioned that I use [Kiko](https://github.com/gfjaru/Kiko), Jekyll
template which looks great on my new blog! Thanks **gfjaru** for creating such a
nice, minimalist theme. Also thanks Github for hosting my personal page. If you
want to host your personal page on Github, follow this [instruction](https://pages.github.com/).

For `favicon`, I create it using [piskel](http://www.piskelapp.com/). It's a really
nice web application to create pixel art.
